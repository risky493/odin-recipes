        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This meaty goulash recipe is easy to make on the stovetop but can also be done in a slow cooker. Inspired by Paula Deen's Bobby's Goulash.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook 3 minutes, stirring often. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up the meat until it is evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 3 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Stir in water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, soy sauce, Italian seasoning, seasoned salt, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
